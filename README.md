### PROJECT:

Sentiment Analysis of the Feedback from Airplane Passengers

### **PROJECT DESCRIPTION**

Airlines provide a wide range of services to their passengers such as meal service on board, luggage service, online check-in, etc. These services are aimed to attract more passengers and put the airline in a better position to compete with other companies.
