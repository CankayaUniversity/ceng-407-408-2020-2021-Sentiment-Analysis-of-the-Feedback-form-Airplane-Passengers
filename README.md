### PROJECT:

Sentiment Analysis of the Feedback from Airplane Passengers

### **PROJECT DESCRIPTION**

Airlines provide a wide range of services to their passengers such as meal service on board, luggage service, online check-in, etc. These services are aimed to attract more passengers and put the airline in a better position to compete with other companies.

From passengers perspective however, not all services are at an acceptable level. They complain about the delays, quality of service, etc. For an airline understanding the nature of these complains or satisfactions is of primary importance.
